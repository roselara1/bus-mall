# H1 User Stories

- As a marketing researcher I want to work with a website that can give me results of what users like the most. It would also let me compare all the items against each other. In addition to this, I will be able to give the users only a certain amount of times before they need to stop.

- As a user I want a simple website that I can use to click on items that I find interesting. I want the process to be easy to understand. It should have instructions that I do not have to think too much on but can remember and follow accordingly.

- As a developer I want to provide a website that lets me *add* or *remove* items within my code without having to make too many changes. I want to design a website that users will find easy to use so that I do not have to go back and work on my code again. I want to provide a simple design within my CSS that will make the page easy to navigate. I want to display the results of user activity in a way that the market research time can understand.
